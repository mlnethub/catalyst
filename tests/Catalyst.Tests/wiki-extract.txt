Early life

Murphy was born in Douglas, County Cork, Ireland, and was raisedin Ballintemple, Cork. His father Brendan worked for the IrishDepartment of Education, and his mother was a French teacher.[2] Hisgrandfather, aunts and uncles were also teachers. Murphy startedplaying music and writing songs at the age of 10.[3] He has a youngerbrother, Páidi Murphy, and two younger sisters, Sile Murphy and OrlaMurphy.[4][5]

He was raised Roman Catholic, and attended the Catholic secondary Murphy (centre), with Dr. Tim Smyth,school Presentation Brothers College; there he did well academically Eoin Ó Súilleabháin and Maria-but got into trouble often, sometimes being suspended, until he Theresa Grandfield, c. 1992decided in his fourth year that misbehaving was not worth thehassle.[2] Not keen on sports, a major part of the school's life, Murphyfound that creative pursuits were not fully nurtured at the school.[4] However, it was in secondary school thathe got his first taste of performing, when he participated in a drama module presented by Pat Kiernan, thedirector of the Corcadorca Theatre Company; Murphy later described the experience as a "huge high" and a"fully alive" feeling that he set out to chase.[6] His English teacher, the poet and novelist William Wall,encouraged him to pursue acting; however, to Murphy, performing meant becoming a rock star.[7]

In his late teens and early twenties, Murphy pursued a career as a musician, singing and playing on the pianoin several bands alongside his brother, Páidi; the Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band 'TheSons of Mr. Greengenes', after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa, which he said "specialised in wackylyrics and endless guitar solos". They were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but did notsign the contract; this was owing to Páidi still being in secondary school, and to the small recompense involvedin ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label.[6][8] Murphy later confessed: "Iam very gladin retrospect that we didnot sign because you kind of sign away your life to a label and the whole of yourmusic."[9]

He began studying law at University College Cork (UCC) in 1996, but he failed his first-year exams because,as he put it, he had "no ambitions to do it".[6] Not only was he busy with his band,[3] but he has said that heknew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca'sstage production of A Clockwork Orange, directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest.[6] Hisfirst major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster MarchingTowards the Somme, which also starred Irish-American comedian Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead ina UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House.According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an actingcareer.[3]

Career1996–2001: Early work

Murphy pressured Pat Kiernan until he got an audition at Corcadorca Theatre Company, and in September1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing the part of a volatile Cork teenager in EndaWalsh's Disco Pigs.[6] Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: "There was something about him – hewas incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and youwould go, "My God". It hadnothing to do with those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time."[10] Murphy observed, "Iwas unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose."[11] Originally intended torun for three weeks in Cork,[6] Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for twoyears, and Murphy left both university[2] and his band.[7] Though he had intended to go back to playingmusic, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting careerbegan to take off.[12]

He starred in many other theatre productions, including Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing (1998), TheCountry Boy, and Juno and the Paycock (both 1999).[13] He began appearing in independent films such as Onthe Edge (2001), and in short films, including Filleann an Feall (2000) and Watchmen (2001).[14] He alsoreprised his role for the film adaption of Disco Pigs (2001) and appeared in the BBC television mini-seriesadaptation of The Way We Live Now.[12][15][16] During this period, he moved from Cork, relocating first toDublin for a few years, then to London in 2001.[17]

2002–2004: 28 Days Later and breakthrough

In 2002, Murphy starred as Adam in a theatre production of Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things at the GateTheatre in Dublin. Writing for The Irish Times, Fintan O'Toole praised Murphy's performance: "Murphymeasures out his metamorphosis with an impressive subtlety and intelligence."[18]

He was cast in the lead role in Danny Boyle's horror film 28 Days Later (2002). He portrayed pandemicsurvivor Jim, who is "perplexed to find himself alone in the desolate, post-apocalyptic world" after wakingfrom a coma in a London hospital.[19] Casting director Gail Stevens suggested that Boyle audition Murphy forthe role, having been impressed with his performance in Disco Pigs. Stevens stated that it was only afterseeing his slender physique during filming that they decided to feature him fully nude at the beginning of thefilm.[20][21] She recalled that Murphy was shy on set with the tendency to look slightly away from the camera,but enthused that he had a "dreamy, slightly de-energised, floating quality that is fantastic for the film."Released in the UK in late 2002, by the following July 28 Days Later had become a sleeper hit in NorthAmerica and a success worldwide, putting Murphy in front of a mass audience for the first time.[22][23] Hisperformance earned him a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 8th Empire Awards and Breakthrough MalePerformance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards.[24][25] Murphy professed that he considered the film to bemuch deeper than a zombie or horror film, expressing surprise at the film's success and that Americanaudiences responded well to its content and violence.[26] Murphy said, "the film did so well. And you watchzombie stuff [now], we were the first people to make zombies run, and [that] changed everything. It has a veryspecial place in my heart, that movie."[27]

In 2005, he played the role of Konstantine in a stage production of Chekhov's The Seagull at the EdinburghInternational Festival. Murphy said he wanted to play Kontastine because the character "goes on this amazingjourney through the play [...] he comes to realise thereis no point being an iconoclastic writer just for the sakeof it, and that the search for new forms has to have something behind it."[28]

He starred as a lovelorn, hapless supermarket stocker who plots a bank heist with Colin Farrell in Intermission(2003), which became the highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box office history (until The WindThat Shakes the Barley broke the record in 2006).[29] Reflecting on his roles in 28 Days Later and the "sad-sack Dublin shelf-stacker" in Intermission, Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune stated that Murphybrought "fluent ease to the roles he takes on, a graceful and wholly believable intensity. His delicate goodlooks have, as much as his acting prowess, caused people to mark him as Ireland's next Colin Farrell, albeitone who seems less likely to be caught tomcatting around or brawling drunkenly at premieres".[30] He had aminor supporting role in the successful Hollywood period drama Cold Mountain (2003). He portrayed adeserting soldier who shares a grim scene with Jude Law's character, and was only on location in Romania fora week. Murphy stated that it was a "massive production", remarking that director Anthony Minghella was thecalmest director hewould ever met.[26] Murphy also had a role as a butcher in Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003)with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.[31]

In 2004, he toured Ireland with the Druid Theatre Company, in The Playboy of the Western World (playing thecharacter of Christy Mahon) under the direction of Garry Hynes—who had previously directed Murphy backin 1999 in the theatre productions of Juno and the Paycock—and also in The Country Boy.[32][33]

2005–2006: Villainous roles and critical success

Murphy starred as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005). Originally asked toaudition for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for thesuperhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Nolan.[17] Though the lead went to Christian Bale,Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Crane, whose alter ego issupervillain Scarecrow.[12] Nolan told Spin magazine, "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and I kept tryingto invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups."[34] He starred as Jackson Rippner, whoterrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye (2005). The New YorkTimes film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made "a picture-perfect villain" and that his "babyblues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors."[35] The film wasfavourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.[36][37]

Murphy received several awards nominations for his 2005 villainous roles, among them a nomination as BestVillain at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for Batman Begins.[38] Entertainment Weekly ranked him among its2005 "Summer MVPs", a cover story list of 10 entertainers with outstanding breakthrough performances.[39]The New Yorker's David Denby wrote: "Cillian Murphy, who has angelic looks that can turn sinister, is one ofthe most elegantly seductive monsters in recent movies."[40]

Murphy starred as Patrick/"Kitten" Braden, a transgender Irish woman in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan's comedy-drama Breakfast on Pluto (2005), based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe. Seen against the film's kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion, magic shows, red-light districts and IRA violence, Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high drag blond bombshell. He had auditioned for the role in 2001, and though Jordan liked him for the part, the director of The Crying Game was hesitant to revisit transgender and IRA issues. The actor lobbied Jordan for several years in a bid to get the film made before Murphy became too old to play the part; in 2004, he prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites.[7] The role required "serious primping" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal,[41] and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character [42][43] Murphy at the New York with a "bemused and hopeful voice". While lukewarm reviews of [44] Film Festival premiere of Breakfast on Pluto tended to praise Murphy's performance highly, a few Breakfast on Pluto, 2005 critics dissented: The Village Voice, which panned the film, found him "unconvincing" and overly cute.[45] Murphy was nominated for a GoldenGlobe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Breakfast on Pluto[46] and won the fourth Irish Filmand Television Academy Best Actor Award.[47] Premiere magazine cited his performance as Kitten in their"The 24 Finest Performances of 2005" feature.[5]

In 2006, Murphy starred in The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a film about the Irish War of Independence andthe Irish Civil War, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and became the mostsuccessful Irish independent film at the Irish box office.[48] Murphy was especially keen on appearing in thefilm due to his intimate connections to Cork, Ireland, where the film was shot. Murphy auditioned six times forthe role of Damien O'Donovan, a young doctor turned revolutionary, before winning the part. Murphyconsidered it a very special privilege to have been given the role and stated that he was "tremendously proud"of the film, remarking that the "memories run very, very deep – the politics, the divisions and everybody hasstories of family members who were caught up in the struggle."[49] David Denby noted Murphy's moments ofdeep stillness and idiosyncrasies in portraying the character.[50] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrotethat "Murphy is especially good at playing the zealotry as well as the soul-searching and the regret, at showingus a man who is eaten up alive because heis forced to act in ways that are contrary to his background and histraining."[51] GQ magazine presented Murphy with its 2006 Actor of the Year award for his work in The WindThat Shakes the Barley.[52]

2006–2010: Further theatre and film roles

Murphy returned to the stage starring opposite Neve Campbell at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London'sWest End from November 2006 to February 2007, playing the lead role of John Kolvenbach's play LoveSong. Theatre Record described his character of Beane as a "winsomely cranky" mentally unstable"sentimentalised lonely hero", noting how he magnetically, with "all blue eyes and twitching hands", moves"comically from painfully shy "wallpaper" to garrulous, amorous male."[53] Variety magazine considered hisperformance to be "as magnetic onstage as onscreen", remarking that his "unhurried puzzlement pulls theslight preciousness in the character's idiot-savant naivete back from the brink".[54]

He starred in the science fiction film Sunshine (2007) as a physicist-astronaut charged with re-igniting the sun,also directed by Danny Boyle.[55] He starred opposite Lucy Liu in Paul Soter's romantic comedy Watching theDetectives (2007); the indie film premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and was released direct-to-DVD.[56] Murphy starred as Richard Neville, editor of the psychedelic radical underground magazine Oz inthe film Hippie Hippie Shake, which was filmed in 2007, but the project, much delayed, was eventuallyshelved in 2011.[57][58]

Murphy made a brief re-appearance as the Scarecrow in Nolan's TheDark Knight (2008), the sequel to Batman Begins,[59] before starringin The Edge of Love—about a love quadrangle involving the poetDylan Thomas—with Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and MatthewRhys.[60] In July 2008, Murphy made a debut appearance in anothermedium—on a postage stamp; the Irish Post Office, An Post, releaseda series of four stamps paying homage to the creativity of filmsrecently produced in Ireland, including one featuring Murphy in a still Murphy (far left) with the cast offrom The Wind That Shakes the Barley.[61] In 2009, Murphy starred Inception at a premiere, July 2010opposite rock singer Feist and actor David Fox in The Water, directedby Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene. The 15-minute Canadianshort film, released online in April 2009, is nearly silent until the Feist song of the same title plays close to theend. Murphy was attracted to the role as a fan of Broken Social Scene and the prospect of making a silentmovie, which he considered to be the "hardest test for any actor".[62] Murphy also starred in Perrier's Bounty,a crime dramedy from the makers of Intermission, in which he portrayed a petty criminal on the run from agangster played by Brendan Gleeson.[63]In 2010, he made a return to theatre in From Galway to Broadway and back again, which was a stage showthat celebrated the Druid Theatre Company's 35th birthday.[64] The direct-to-video psychological thrillerPeacock (2010), co-starring Elliot Page, Susan Sarandon and Bill Pullman, starred Murphy as a man with asplit personality who fools people into believing he is also his own wife. Christian Toto of The WashingtonTimes referred to the film as "a handsomely mounted psychological drama with an arresting lead turn byCillian Murphy", and noted that although Murphy wasnot a stranger to playing in drag, his work in the film seta "new standard for gender-bending performances".[65] Murphy next starred in Christopher Nolan's Inception(2010), playing entrepreneur Robert Fischer, whose mind is infiltrated by DiCaprio's character Cobb toconvince him to dissolve his business.[66] That year, Murphy also made an uncredited cameo as programmerEdward Dillinger Jr., son of original Tron antagonist Ed Dillinger (David Warner) in Tron: Legacy.[67]

2011–present: Thrillers and Peaky Blinders

In 2011, Murphy performed in the stage monodrama Misterman, written and directed by Enda Walsh, whomMurphy previously worked with on Disco Pigs. The production was initially staged in Galway and was takento St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Murphy commented of the role, "The live nature of itmakes it so dangerous. Youare only there because of the good will of the audience, and thatis compounded byits being a one-man show".[10] His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Awardand a Drama Desk Award.[68][69] Sarah Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy'scharacter Thomas Magill to be a "complicated mixture of sympathetic and not nice at all – deeply wounded,but with a dangerous, skewed moral code", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's"unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage inthe intense one-man show Misterman", and documented that on one evening the "theater was flooded, notwith applause but with silence", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance.[10]He played the lead in the British horror film Retreat (2011), which had a limited release. He also appeared inthe science fiction film In Time (2011), starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorlyreviewed.[70]

Murphy starred in Red Lights (2012) with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character who is a paranormal investigator. Murphy considered working with De Niro to have been one of the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You cannot act presence. Iwill never have that. Watching him use it...when you put a Murphy in Berlin, 2014 camera on it, it just becomes something else."[71] The film was panned by critics and under-performed at the box office.[72][73] Murphy went on to reprise his role as the Scarecrow for the third timein The Dark Knight Rises (2012),[74] and had a supporting role as Mike, the favourite teacher of the maincharacter Skunk, in the British independent film Broken (2012). His performance earned him a BritishIndependent Film Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.[75]

Since 2013, Murphy has played the lead role, Tommy Shelby, in the BBC television series Peaky Blinders, aseries about a criminal gang in post-First World War Birmingham.[76] He explained his enthusiasm for theshow in an interview with The Independent: "[the scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the characterwas so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'"[77] Peaky Blinders waspraised and received high ratings. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. OnAugust 25, the first episode of season 5 was broadcast on BBC One. In an interview with Digital Spy,[78]director Anthony Byrne said, "if we did start shooting in January (2021), we wouldnot finish until May or Juneand then itis another 6 months of editing." This would place the release date for Peaky Blinders season 6 at theend of 2021, or the beginning of 2022. In 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for theband Money's single Hold Me Forever. The video features dancers from the English National Ballet and wasfilmed at The Old Vic Theatre in London.[79]

In 2014, he co-starred in the drama Aloft with Jennifer Connelly,[80] and Wally Pfister's Transcendence withJohnny Depp and Rebecca Hall.[81] Both of these features garnered mostly unfavourable critic reviewsaccording to the aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[82][83] That same year, Murphy reunited with Enda Walsh in theplay Ballyturk.[84][85] He starred in Ron Howard's 2015 film, In the Heart of the Sea, which also featuresBenjamin Walker and Chris Hemsworth.[86] In 2015, he contributed spoken vocals to the tracks "8:58" and"The Clock" from Paul Hartnoll's album 8:58. The two previously met while Hartnoll was scoring the secondseason of Peaky Blinders.[87] Murphy portrayed Czechoslovak World War II army soldier Jozef Gabčík, whowas involved in Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Anthropoid (2016).[88]Rupert Hawksley of The Telegraph believed Cillian's performance, but opined that he is "not asked to do anawful lot, other than smoke and look perplexed."[89]

Murphy played a shell-shocked army officer who is recovered from a wrecked ship in Christopher Nolan'swar film, Dunkirk (2017). Murphy felt his character, who is nameless and was credited simply as "ShiveringSoldier", was "representative of something experienced by thousands of soldiers, which is the profoundemotional and psychological toll that war can have".[90]

Personal life

Family

In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness whom he had met in 1996 at oneof his rock band's shows.[91] The couple live in Dublin (where they moved back in 2015 after previouslyliving for 14 years in London) and have two sons, Malachy, born in December 2005, and Aran, born in July2007.[92][93] He has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood.[94] He prefers not to speak about his personallife, and did not appear on any television talk shows until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Showon Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty, yet still remained reserved.[95][96]

Lifestyle and social causes

Music is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, "The only extravagant thing about mylifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs."[6] He no longer plays in a rock band, butregularly plays music with friends and on his own,[97] and still writes songs.[4] Murphy does not plan to startanother band, and said, "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the sidewould mean Iwould never be taken seriously."[8]

Murphy was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but becauseof qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices.[98] He began eating meat again for his role in PeakyBlinders.[99] He is a dedicated runner.[100] Murphy had previously been verging on agnostic, but confirmedhis atheism after researching his role as a physicist-astronaut in Sunshine (2007).[101][102]

Murphy does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends filmpremieres alone.[94][103] Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene,finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome".[104] He intentionallypractises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: "I haven't created any controversy, I donot sleep around, Idon't go and fall down drunk".[4] In 2005, Murphy stated he was friends with fellow Irish actors ColinFarrell,[105] Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a "surrogate moviedad".[106] But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.[107][97]

Murphy participated in the 2007 Rock the Vote Ireland campaign, targeting young voters for the generalelection,[97] and campaigning for the rights of the homeless with the organisation Focus Ireland.[108] In 2011,he became a patron of the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at the National University of IrelandGalway. He is closely associated with the work of Professor Pat Dolan Director UCFRC and UNESCO Chairin Children, Youth and Civic Engagement. In February 2012, he wrote a message of support to the former VitaCortex workers involved in a sit-in at their plant, congratulating them for "highlighting [what] is hugelyimportant to us all as a nation".[109][110] In 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed men.[111]
